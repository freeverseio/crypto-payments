 * @dev The contract that implements this interface adds an entry point for BuyNow payments,
 * which are defined and documented in the inherited IBuyNowBase.
 * - in the 'buyNow' method, the buyer is the msg.sender (the buyer therefore signs the TX),
 *   and the operator's EIP712-signature of the BuyNowInput struct is provided as input to the call.
