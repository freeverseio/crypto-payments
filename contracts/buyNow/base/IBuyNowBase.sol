/**
 * @title Interface to base Escrow Contract for Payments in BuyNow mode.
 * @author Freeverse.io, www.freeverse.io
 * @dev The contract that implements this interface only operates the BuyNow path of a payment;
 * it derives from previously audited code, except for minimal method name changes and
 * several methods changed from 'private' to 'internal'
 * The contract that implements this interface can be inherited to:
 * - conduct buyNows in either native crypto or ERC20 tokens
 * - add more elaborated payment processes (such as Auctions)
 *
 * The contract that implements this interface operates as an escrow
 * for paying for assets in BuyNow mode: the first buyer that
 * executes the buyNow method gets the asset.
 *
 * ROLES: Buyers/bidders explicitly sign the agreement to let the specified Operator address
 * act as an Oracle, responsible for signing the success or failure of the asset transfer,
 * which is conducted outside this contract upon reception of funds.
 *
 * If no confirmation is received from the Operator during the PaymentWindow,
 * all funds received from the buyer are made available to him/her for refund.
 * Throughout the contract, this moment is labeled as 'expirationTime'.
 *
 * To start a payment, signatures of both the buyer and the Operator are required, and they
 * are checked in the contracts that inherit from this one.
 *
 * The contract that implements this interface maintains the balances of all users,
 * which can be withdrawn via explicit calls to the various 'withdraw' methods.
 * If a buyer has a non-zero local balance at the moment of starting a new payment,
 * the contract reuses it, and only requires the provision of the remainder funds required (if any).
 *
 * Each BuyNow has the following State Machine:
 * - NOT_STARTED -> ASSET_TRANSFERRING, triggered by buyNow
 * - ASSET_TRANSFERRING -> PAID, triggered by relaying assetTransferSuccess signed by Operator
 * - ASSET_TRANSFERRING -> REFUNDED, triggered by relaying assetTransferFailed signed by Operator
 * - ASSET_TRANSFERRING -> REFUNDED, triggered by a refund request after expirationTime
 *
 * NOTE: To ensure that the payment process proceeds as expected when the payment starts,
 * upon acceptance of a payment, the following data: {operator, feesCollector, expirationTime}
 * is stored in the payment struct, and used throughout the payment, regardless of
 * any possible modifications to the contract's storage.
 *
 * NOTE: The contract allows a feature, 'Seller Registration', that can be used in the scenario that
 * applications want users to prove that they have enough crypto know-how (obtain native crypto,
 * pay for gas using a web3 wallet, etc.) to interact by themselves with this smart contract before selling,
 * so that they are less likely to require technical help in case they need to withdraw funds.
 * - If _isSellerRegistrationRequired = true, this feature is enabled, and payments can only be initiated
 *    if the payment seller has previously executed the registerAsSeller method.
 * - If _isSellerRegistrationRequired = false, this feature is disabled, and payments can be initiated
 *    regardless of any previous call to the registerAsSeller method.
 *
 * NOTE: Following audits suggestions, the EIP712 contract, which uses OpenZeppelin's implementation,
 * is not inherited; it is separately deployed, so that it can be upgraded should the standard evolve in the future.
