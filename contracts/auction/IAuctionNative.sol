/**
 * @title Interface to Escrow Contract for Payments in Auction & BuyNow modes, in Native Cryptocurrencies.
 * @author Freeverse.io, www.freeverse.io
 * @dev The contract that implements this interface adds an entry point for Bid processes in Auctions,
 * which are defined and documented in the AuctionBase contract.
 * - in the 'bid' method, the buyer is the msg.sender (the buyer therefore signs the TX),
 *   and the Operator's EIP712-signature of the BidInput struct is provided as input to the call.
 *
 *  When a bidder is outbid by a different user, he/she is automatically refunded to this contract's
 *  local balance. Accepting a new bid and transferring funds to the previous bidder in the same TX would
 *  not be a safe operation, since the external address could contain malicious implementations
 *  on arrival of new funds.

     *  whereas if it arrives on an on-going auction, it remains in AUCTIONING.
