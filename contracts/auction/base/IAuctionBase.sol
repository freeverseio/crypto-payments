/**
 * @title Interface for a base Escrow Contract for Payments, that adds
 * an Auction mode to an inherited contract that implements the BuyNow mode.
 * @author Freeverse.io, www.freeverse.io
 * @dev The contract that implements this interface inherits the payment process 
 * required to conduct BuyNows, and extends it with Auctioning capabilities,
 * adding new entry points to start Auctions via bid methods, and reusing all the
 * State Machine, refund and withdraw methods of BuyNows after an auction finishes. 
 *
 * The contract that implements this interface can be inherited to conduct
 * auctions/buyNows in either native crypto or ERC20 tokens.

 * Buyers/bidders explicitly sign the agreement to let the specified Operator address
 * act as an Oracle, responsible for signing the success or failure of the asset transfer,
 * which is conducted outside this contract upon reception of funds in a Buynow, or
 * completion of an Auction.
 *
 * If no confirmation is received from the Operator during the PaymentWindow,
 * all funds received from the buyer/bidder are made available to him/her for refund.
 * Throughout the contract, this moment is labeled as 'expirationTime'.
 *
 * To start an auction, signatures of both the buyer and the Operator are required, and they
 * are checked in the contracts that inherit from this one. 
 *
 * The variable 'uint256 paymentId' is used to uniquely identify the started process, regardless
 * of whether it is a BuyNow or an Auction.
 *
 * The contract that implements this interface maintains the balances of all users,
 * which can be withdrawn via explicit calls to the various 'withdraw' methods.
 * If a buyer/bidder has a non-zero local balance at the moment of executing buyNow/bid,
 * the contract reuses it, and only requires the provision of the
 * remainder funds required (if any).
 *
 * Auctions start with an initial bid, and an initial 'endsAt' time,
 * and are characterized by: {minIncreasePercentage, timeToExtend, extendableUntil}.
 * - New bids need to provide and increase of at least minIncreasePercentage;
 * - 'Late bids', defined as those that arrive during the time window [endsAt - timeToExtend, endsAt],
 *   increment endsAt by an amount equal to timeToExtend, with max accumulated extension capped by extendableUntil.
 *
 * Each payment has the following State Machine:
 * - NOT_STARTED -> ASSET_TRANSFERRING, triggered by buyNow
 * - NOT_STARTED -> AUCTIONING, triggered by bid
 * - AUCTIONING -> AUCTIONING, triggered by successive bids
 * - AUCTIONING -> ASSET_TRANSFERRING, triggered when block.timestamp > endsAt;
 *   in this case, this transition is an implicit one, reflected by the change in the return
 *   state of the paymentState method.
 * - ASSET_TRANSFERRING -> PAID, triggered by relaying assetTransferSuccess signed by Operator
 * - ASSET_TRANSFERRING -> REFUNDED, triggered by relaying assetTransferFailed signed by Operator
 * - ASSET_TRANSFERRING -> REFUNDED, triggered by a refund request after expirationTime
 *
 * NOTE: To ensure that the every process proceeds as expected when the payment starts,
 * the following configuration data is stored uniquely for every payment when it is created,
 * remaining unmodified regardless of any possible changes to the contract's storage defaults:
 * - In BuyNow payments: {operator, feesCollector, expirationTime}
 * - In Auctions: {operator, feesCollector, expirationTime, minIncreasePercentage, timeToExtend, extendableUntil}
 *
 * NOTE: The contract allows a feature, 'Seller Registration', that can be used in the scenario that
 * applications want users to prove that they have enough crypto know-how (obtain native crypto,
 * pay for gas using a web3 wallet, etc.) to interact by themselves with this smart contract before selling,
 * so that they are less likely to require technical help in case they need to withdraw funds.
 * - If _isSellerRegistrationRequired = true, this feature is enabled, and payments can only be initiated
 *    if the payment seller has previously executed the registerAsSeller method.
 * - If _isSellerRegistrationRequired = false, this feature is disabled, and payments can be initiated
 *    regardless of any previous call to the registerAsSeller method.
 *
 * NOTE: Following previous audits suggestions, the EIP712 contract, which uses OpenZeppelin's implementation,
 * is not inherited; it is separately deployed, so that it can be upgraded should the standard evolve in the future.
